# WWCast
WWCast is an Android application for showing the local forecast for the upcoming week (daily and hourly), you can see the precipitation, wind speed and more. 
You can adjust some of the measurment units and formats from the settings activity.

This is my first application that is written entirely in Kotlin, I also used MVVM design pattern, Dagger 2, retrofit, Room, Dark Sky API's and RxJava.

Version 1.1
1) redesigned the application
2) added time and date functionalities
3) added hourly forecast
4) You can now choose the date/time format in the application

When you download the source of code you will need to add manually the Dark Sky API KEY.
The location of the key is constants
