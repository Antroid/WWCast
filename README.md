# WWCast
WWCast to see forecast for the upcoming week depending on your location, you can see the precipitation, wind speed, humidity levels and 
change the temperature and wind speed units  
This is my first application that is written entirely in Kotlin, I also used MVVM design pattern, Dagger 2, retrofit, Room, Dark Sky API's and RxJava.

When you download the source of code you will need to add manually the Dark Sky API KEY.
The location of the key is constants
